# SECURITY.md

- Report vulnerabilities privately to **security@reagent.systems** or via
  GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability" on the Security
  tab). **Never open a public issue for a vulnerability.**
- Acknowledgment within 72 hours; fix-or-plan within 14 days;
  coordinated disclosure after a fix ships.
- Supported: latest minor release, unless stated otherwise.
- Secrets never enter the repo — not code, config, fixtures, or history.
  CI uses Actions secrets; local dev uses untracked `.env` with a
  committed `.env.example`.
- For the agent: security-shaped work overrides normal routing. A
  security fix may ship out-of-band as a patch release at any time,
  without waiting for the weekly cycle.
